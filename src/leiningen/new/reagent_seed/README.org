* Usage

** Generate Source Code from Org Files

In the top-level of your application, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
./scripts/watch.sh src/ ./scripts/tangle-all.sh
#+END_SRC

Press =C-c= to force the initial tangle. If you make any changes to
your .org files, they will automatically get tangled. Press =C-\= to
quit.

Tangling is the process of extracting & combining source blocks from
=.org= files into an actual working project/source tree. Once tangling
is complete, you can =cd= into the generated project directory
(=generated=) and then use =lein= as usual.

** From Inside =generated= Directory

*** Start Cider from Emacs

Put this in your Emacs config file:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
(setq cider-cljs-lein-repl "(do (use 'figwheel-sidecar.repl-api) (start-figwheel!) (cljs-repl))")
#+END_SRC

Navigate to a clojurescript file and start a figwheel REPL with =cider-jack-in-clojurescript= or (=C-c M-J=)

*** Compile css

Compile css file once.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
lein garden once
#+END_SRC

Automatically recompile css file on change.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
lein garden auto
#+END_SRC

*** Run application:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
lein clean
lein figwheel dev
#+END_SRC

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

Wait a bit, then browse to [[http://localhost:3449]].

*** Run tests:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
lein clean
lein doo phantom test once
#+END_SRC

The above command assumes that you have [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/phantomjs][phantomjs]] installed. However, please note that [[https://github.com/bensu/doo][doo]] can be configured to run cljs.test in many other JS environments (chrome, ie, safari, opera, slimer, node, rhino, or nashorn).

*** Devcards

#+BEGIN_SRC 
lein clean
lein figwheel devcards
#+END_SRC

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser. Wait a bit, then browse to [[http://localhost:3449/cards.html]].

To build a minified version:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
lein clean
lein cljsbuild once hostedcards
#+END_SRC

Then open =resources/public/cards.html=

*** Production Build

#+BEGIN_SRC 
lein clean
lein cljsbuild once min
#+END_SRC
