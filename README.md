# Reagent-Seed (leiningen template)

**Orgmode** + Reagent + Cider + Figwheel ... what could ~~go wrong~~ be better?

This template was deprecated, but I figured I'd revive it and turn it
into an Emacs-focused monster.  The template includes:

* [reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent)
* [cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider)
* [devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards)
* [doo](https://github.com/bensu/doo)
* [figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel)
* [garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden)
* [secretary](https://github.com/gf3/secretary)

## Usage

### Create a new application:

```
lein new reagent-seed <app-name>
```

### Generate Source Code from Org Files

In the top-level of your application, run:

```
./scripts/watch.sh src/ ./scripts/tangle-all.sh
```

Press `C-c` to force the initial tangle. If you make any changes to
your .org files, they will automatically get tangled. Press `C-\` to
quit.

Tangling is the process of extracting & combining source blocks from
`.org` files into an actual working project/source tree. Once tangling
is complete, you can `cd` into the generated project directory
(`generated`) and then use `lein` as usual.

### From Inside `generated` Directory

#### Start Cider from Emacs

Put this in your Emacs config file:

```
(setq cider-cljs-lein-repl "(do (use 'figwheel-sidecar.repl-api) (start-figwheel!) (cljs-repl))")
```

Navigate to a clojurescript file and start a figwheel REPL with `cider-jack-in-clojurescript` or (`C-c M-J`).

#### Compile css

Compile css file once.

```
lein garden once
```

Automatically recompile css file on change.

```
lein garden auto
```

#### Run application:

```
lein clean
lein figwheel dev
```

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449).

#### Run tests:

```
lein clean
lein doo phantom test once
```

The above command assumes that you have [phantomjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phantomjs) installed. However, please note that [doo](https://github.com/bensu/doo) can be configured to run cljs.test in many other JS environments (chrome, ie, safari, opera, slimer, node, rhino, or nashorn).

#### Devcards

```
lein clean
lein figwheel devcards
```

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser. Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:3449/cards.html](http://localhost:3449/cards.html).

To build a minified version:

```
lein clean
lein cljsbuild once hostedcards
```

Then open *resources/public/cards.html*

#### Production Build

```
lein clean
lein cljsbuild once min
```
